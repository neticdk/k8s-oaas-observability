# Contribution

## First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? 
- You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
   * Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   * Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
   * Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

## Code Contribution Guideline
This repository is currently a private repository and thus have no ability to apply rules for commits. Thus everyone is urged to not commit directly to main and use a feature branch instead. The feature branched are names with "feature/\<feature>". Please use a pull-request from the feature branch as the way to merge to main - an appointed person such as tal@netic.dk should be reviewing the contribution targetted for the merge. Please ensure that the code has been proofed and tested before the pre-merge review using the pull-request.
