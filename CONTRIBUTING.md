# Contributing to this project

This needs to be completed ... in order to help the community get started as we hopefully grow. A few examples of concerns are listed underneath. 


# Commit Guideline
This repository is currently a private repository and thus have no ability to apply rules for commits. Thus everyone is urged to not commit directly to main and use a feature branch instead. The feature branched are names with "feature/\<feature>". Please use a pull-request from the feature branch as the way to merge to main - an appointed person such as tal@netic.dk should be reviewing the contribution targetted for the merge. Please ensure that the code has been proofed and tested before the pre-merge review using the pull-request.

# Styleguides

## Git Commit Messages
Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
Start the commit message with an applicable [emoji](https://gitmoji.dev/)


# First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing? 
- You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
   * Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
   * Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
   * Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
